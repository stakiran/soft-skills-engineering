# Soft Skills Engineering

## About This Document
This isn't Software Engineering; it's **Soft Skills Engineering**. For the abbreviation, we use SSE rather than SWE.

SSE is a framework organized by [sta](https://github.com/stakiran). It aims to help developers become able to handle soft skills freely—skills that developers often tend to avoid.

As needed, we use, build, and modify software—and soft skills are the same. In other words, SSE **treats soft skills as something that can be engineered**. To do so, it organizes the necessary knowledge and supports readers in acquiring the fundamentals and key points.
