# Soft Skills Engineering

## About This Document
This is not Software Engineering, but **Soft Skills Engineering**. For the abbreviation, we use SSE rather than SWE.

SSE is a framework developed by [sta](https://github.com/stakiran). It aims to help developers become able to handle soft skills freely, even though developers tend to shy away from them.

We use, build, and modify software as needed, and soft skills are no different. In other words, SSE **treats soft skills as an engineering subject as well**. To that end, it organizes the necessary knowledge and helps readers acquire foundational qualities and key insights.
