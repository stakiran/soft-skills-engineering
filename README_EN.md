# Soft Skills Engineering | [English](README_EN.md)
## What is this?
This is not **Software Engineering**, but **Soft Skills Engineering**. Even the abbreviation is SSE, not SWE.

SSE is a framework organized by [sta](https://github.com/stakiran). It aims to help developers become able to handle soft skills freely—skills that developers tend to shy away from.

We use, build, and modify software as needed; soft skills are no different. In other words, SSE **treats soft skills as an engineering subject** as well. To that end, it organizes the necessary knowledge and supports readers in acquiring the fundamentals and key insights.
