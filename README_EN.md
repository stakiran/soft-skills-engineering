# Soft Skills Engineering | [English](README_EN.md)
This isn't Software Engineering—it's **Soft Skills Engineering**. For the abbreviation, we use SSE rather than SWE.

SSE is a framework organized by [sta](https://github.com/stakiran). It aims to help developers gain the ability to handle soft skills freely—skills developers tend to shy away from.

We use, build, and modify software as needed, and soft skills are the same. In other words, SSE **treats soft skills as an engineering domain**. To make that possible, we organize the necessary knowledge and support readers in acquiring the fundamentals and the key points.
