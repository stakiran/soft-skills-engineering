# What Is Soft Skill Engineering?
We'll first dig into what soft skills are, and then define what it means to *engineer* them.

## What Are Soft Skills?
**Soft skills** refer to **skills for dealing with people**. "People" includes both yourself and others, and "dealing with" covers not only communication but also documentation, creative thinking, management, and more. Even within communication there are synchronous and asynchronous forms, and within management there is self-management as well—in that sense, it's an extremely broad domain.

When you hear "skills," you might think of hard skills. **Hard skills** are skills for handling machines and tools, laws and regulations, accounting, and other academically established systems. Even if they involve people, medicine is a hard skill, and psychology and economics might also be included as hard skills.

Put differently, what separates hard from soft is whether there is a correct answer. Hard skills have correct answers, and can be measured reliably in quantitative and/or qualitative ways. You could also say you can know the outcome. In contrast, **soft skills are not like that: there is no correct answer. What exists is only a decision and its result**. That's because they deal with human beings—something extremely complex and something that must be respected.

## Soft Skills ≒ Communication Skills? No.
A definition you often see is "Soft skills are mainly skills related to communication," but you should discard that definition immediately. Communication skills are only one component of soft skills. If anything, getting fixated on communication skills leaves you with no room to think about other soft skills.

Communication skills within soft skills are like the C language in programming. They're fundamental, and with them you can do a lot—but they're also classical and primitive. People and organizations that keep chanting "communication skills" are like people who keep chanting "C language."

## Soft Skills Are Like Software
I wrote that soft skills have no correct answers. What exists instead is each person's—and each organization's—way of being.

Let's use 1on1s as an example.

- Soft skills/
    - Communication/
        - 1on1/
            - ★Right here

There is no single correct way to do 1on1s. It might be a 30-minute one-on-one meeting held monthly between a manager and a direct report. Or it might be weekly. The topics might range from serious ones like work and career to simple small talk. And even with the same manager, they would likely vary the approach depending on the person and situation.

What's important is to give specificity to the "answerless practice" of 1on1s. You could even call it implementing. It's the same as software. **Just as you implement software from requirements, you create a concrete, operational form from the concept of a 1on1 and then run it**.

For example, you could consider an implementation like the following:

- 1on1:
    - Participants: A manager and a direct report meet 1:1
    - Frequency: Monthly by default, but weekly is also allowed
    - Duration: Within 30 minutes
    - Content: This term's goals, or mid-to-long-term career topics
    - Method: Online meeting, but in-person is possible with advance coordination

It looks just like a function or an instance. Of course, by changing the parameters, you can create a different implementation. See below:

- Free 1on1:
    - Participants: Two employees meet 1:1
    - Frequency: Monthly by default, but weekly is also allowed
    - Duration: Within 30 minutes
    - Content: Anything
    - Method: Online meeting

I'm developing a model called "Free 1on1," where "any employee can request a 1on1 with anyone, anytime." The original inspiration is GitLab's [Coffee Chat](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats).

Because this is developing a concept, it may look difficult, but it's not. As described above, it's nothing more than a configuration file.

Do you see it now? **Soft skills are like software: each of us can implement them**.

## Soft Skills Won't Run on Their Own
However, there's one point that's clearly different from software. Software runs just by being executed, but **soft skills must be operated by humans themselves**.

The "Free 1on1" described above is also just text. People have to act on it. Of course, you can't suddenly make the whole company adopt it (in software terms, deploy it as a company-wide system). If you truly want to do it, you might submit it formally as a proposal, or start small as a volunteer effort and build momentum bottom-up. Naturally, this requires communication, management, and many other soft skills.

In this respect, it's similar to software. During software development, you use a lot of software tools. Likewise, **when developing soft skills, you also use many soft skills**.

## What Is Soft Skill Engineering?
Now that we're ready, let's get to the main topic.

**Soft Skill Engineering** is the engineering discipline for enabling you to handle soft skills yourself. It includes verbalizing implicit things, customizing existing ones, and of course creating brand-new ones from scratch. Since it's a long name, it's sometimes abbreviated as **SSE**.

It is engineering, but the approach is soft-leaning rather than hard-leaning. In other words, it's not a "game-like world" where there are one or a few absolute theories or phenomena, and everything is about learning them, practicing, gaining experience, and mastering them. It's much softer.

Just as software consists of parts like functions and modules, soft skills also consist of parts called **concepts (verbalized text)**. "Concepts" may sound abstract, but here you should think of them as including anything that has been put into words—concrete procedures and other lists, guidelines that state clear principles, and so on. Of course, some concepts have been proven effective through research, while others are simply articulated on a whim by a particular individual.

## What Is Soft Skill Engineering? (Again)
With that, we can define it even more clearly.

**Soft Skill Engineering is the engineering discipline for creating concepts**. This includes **(1) creating concepts themselves, and (2) combining concepts to implement some soft skill**. It's a system organized so that anyone can do these two things.

There is no correct answer for concepts. While they differ in effectiveness and authority, **you are free to use anything**. We call this property "soft." In contrast, in the world of hard skills, there are one or a few correct answers or theories, and everything depends on how well you can follow and internalize them. Essentially, it's a game. To win, you have no choice but to choose and keep using the most established methods available. We called this common property "hard."

Software engineering is hard, and we developers, managers, and others involved in business tend to prefer hard things—but Soft Skill Engineering is different. It's soft.

## Summary
Soft skills:

- Soft skills refer to the full range of skills for dealing with people
    - Not limited to communication skills
- Soft skills resemble software
    - You implement them by combining parts called concepts
    - You operate what you implement
    - In implementing and operating, you can also use many soft skills
- However, unlike software, they don't operate on their own; humans must always operate them themselves

Concepts:

- Concepts are verbalized text, and include everything from abstract ways of thinking to concrete ways of doing things
- Authoritative, validated concepts and personal, off-the-cuff concepts are equally concepts

Soft Skill Engineering:

- Soft Skill Engineering is the engineering discipline for creating soft skills or their component parts (concepts), and is abbreviated as SSE
- SSE deals with a soft world
    - Hard world: A world where there is one or a few correct answers, and what matters is how well you can follow them. A game-like world.
    - Soft world: A world with no correct answers; there is only decision-making and its results
