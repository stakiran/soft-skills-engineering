# About This Book

## Language
This book is written in Japanese and translated into English using generative AI.

## Intended Audience
This book is intended for developers.

It primarily targets engineers who write code, such as software engineers, SREs, and some infrastructure engineers. It also assumes senior engineers such as engineering managers and staff engineers.

This book provides explanations aimed at developers and sometimes uses analogies. If you do not fit the assumed developer profile, some parts may be difficult to understand.

## How to Read
You need to read from Chapter 1 onward, in order. This is because we define original terms and then use them to develop the discussion.

If you encounter a term you do not understand, go back to the previous pages.

## Notation
Important terms and content are shown in **bold**.

Code blocks (especially in Markdown) may be used to present concrete examples and templates.

Lists are often used when enumerating items. We sometimes add numbers like 1: or 2:, but note that they are not necessarily steps. They are used as identifiers to distinguish each line.

## References
Although this document is positioned as technical documentation, it is neither a paper nor a book. There are no references.

If you want to verify validity or find supporting evidence, please look it up yourself using generative AI or other sources.
