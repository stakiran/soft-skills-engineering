# About This Book

## Language
This book is written in Japanese and translated into English using generative AI.

## Intended Audience
This book is intended for developers.

It primarily targets engineers who write code, such as software engineers, SREs, and some infrastructure engineers. It also assumes senior engineers such as engineering managers and staff engineers.

This book includes explanations aimed at developers, sometimes using analogies. If you don't fit the developer profile assumed here, some parts may be difficult to follow.

## How to Read
You need to read from Chapter 1 onward in order, because the book defines its own terms and then uses them to develop the discussion.

If you run into an unfamiliar term, go back to the earlier pages.

## Notation
Important terms and content are shown in **bold**.

Code blocks (especially in Markdown) may be used to present concrete examples or templates.

Lists are often used when enumerating elements. Sometimes items are labeled with numbers like 1: or 2:, but note that these are not necessarily steps. They are used as identifiers for each line.

## References
This document is positioned as technical documentation, but it is neither an academic paper nor a book. There are no references.

If you want to check validity or sources, please look them up yourself using generative AI or other means.
