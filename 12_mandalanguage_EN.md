# Mandalanguage
Mandalanguage is a communication method that uses a 3x3 grid as the format for messages.

Despite its simple format, it's easy on both readers and writers, and because you can handle it like a card, it's approachable even for beginners. Soft-skill development calls for exploratory and creative work, and methods often end up reflecting that flavor, but Mandalanguage should be relatively easy to use even for beginners.

## First, understand the mandala
I'd like to define one term. A **mandala (Mandal)** refers to a 3x3 grid format like the following.

| - | - | - |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | **5** | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |

The numbering of the cells is fixed in this order starting from the top left.

Cell 5 is the center cell, where you place the theme. In other words, **a mandala is something where you write comments about the theme in the eight surrounding cells**. This means you can write up to eight items, and you don't have to fill them all. For example, you can fill only cells 1 and 2, or only cells 7 and 6.

## Example
Below is an explanation of Mandalanguage using a mandala.

| - | - | - |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 3x3 (mandala) | Use mandalas as a common format | Put the topic in the center |
| Write comments in the eight surrounding cells | **What Mandalanguage is** | Keep it short enough that it doesn't wrap |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |

Text is written in five cells: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Nothing is written in 7, 8, or 9.

## How to represent a mandala
In Markdown, use table notation. It's best to use the following format. Make the center cell bold to make it stand out.

```
| - | - | - |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | **5** | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
```

You can also use Excel or Google Sheets. However, it's a hassle to create a mandala sheet every time you need to send something. Rather, it's better to create one in advance and have people view it or fill it in. If you put it in the cloud, simultaneous editing is also possible.

## Benefits of Mandalanguage
- Clear and easy to understand thanks to its straightforward format
    - The theme is in the center, and there are eight related comments around it
    - You can grasp it at a glance
- Easy to write in
    - The constraint of filling eight slots feels just right, making it easier to write
- Easy to handle
    - One mandala equals one card, so you can treat them like cards to collect and combine them
